## 📌 Project Summary

- 🔍 Performed data cleaning, missing value handling, and feature engineering on credit risk dataset.  
- 🌱 Engineered domain-specific features like debt-to-income ratio, credit history length.  
- ⚖️ Balanced imbalanced data using SMOTE to improve model fairness.  
- 🌲 Built and tuned classification models (Random Forest) for loan default prediction.  
- 📊 Evaluated model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
- 🔍 Applied SHAP for interpreting feature contributions and model decisions.  
- 📋 Developed a credit scorecard in Excel for practical risk scoring.
